== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter your ActiveCampaign account ID into the ‘AC Tracking’ Settings page.

Your account ID can be found within the official ActiveCampaign Tracking Code. Head to your ActiveCampaign profile’s **Settings > Tracking > Tracking Code** section and look for the numbers that come between **actid=** and the following **&**.
